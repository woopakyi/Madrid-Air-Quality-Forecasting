# Madrid-Air-Quality-Forecasting-LSTM
This project implements an LSTM-based deep learning model in PyTorch for time series forecasting of air quality in Madrid using the Kaggle dataset (2001-2018). It covers data preprocessing, model training/evaluation, and extra features like station clustering with KMeans/DBSCAN. Includes Jupyter notebook and model weights.
